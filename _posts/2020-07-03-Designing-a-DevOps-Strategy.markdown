Primarily , the big cloud providers like AWS , Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure offer a huge range and variety of services and selecting the right services, to create the right cloud platform, in a cost efficient way, needs expert help.

Secondly, cloud expertise are tough to find and your in-house teams might not have the desired skills and expertise. Your costs can quickly shoots up unless you put the right cost-control mechanisms in place.

For a successful DevOps transformation, the aim is to find team members with the following characteristics:

* They already think there is a need to change.
* They have previously shown an ability to innovate.
* They are already well-respected within the organization.
* They have a broad knowledge of the organization and how it operates.
* Ideally, they already believe that DevOps practices are what is needed.

### Selecting Groups to Minimize Initial Resistance

Not all staff members within an organization will be receptive to the change that is required for a DevOps transformation. In discussions around continuous delivery, users are often categorized into three general buckets:

* Canaries who voluntarily test bleeding edge features as soon as they are available.
* Early adopters who voluntarily preview releases, considered more refined than the code that canary users are exposed to.
* Users who consume the products, after passing through canaries and early adopters.

While development and IT operations staff might generally be expected to be less conservative than users, their attitudes will also range from very conservative, to early adopters, and to those happy to work at the innovative edge.

### Ideal DevOps team members

For a successful DevOps transformation, the aim is to find team members with the following characteristics:

* They already think there is a need to change.
* They have previously shown an ability to innovate.
* They are already well-respected within the organization.
* They have a broad knowledge of the organization and how it operates.
* Ideally, they already believe that DevOps practices are what is needed.

Cloud-native companies have changed a lot how theyâ€™re organized, moving from large divisions (development, QA, operations, release) to smaller, independent development teams.
These application development teams are supported by two new engineering teams:

* Site reliability engineering
* Platform engineering.

SRE and Platform engineering teams are generally spiritual successor of traditional operations teams, and bring they naturally the discipline of software engineering to different aspects of operations. Site reliability engineering and platform engineering are two functions that are critical to optimizing engineering organizations for building cloud-native applications.

Having a platform engineering team in your company can help bridge the gap between hardware and software infrastructure. A Cloud Platform Engineering Team ideally should achieve following:

* Orchestrate complex cloud systems that enhance satisfaction at scale.
* Scaled onboarding
* Ecosystem enablement
* Certification & validation
* Product / platform sustenance
* Enterprise security
